## API Usage

This application uses the CoinGecko API to fetch cryptocurrency data. The API is called with the following parameters:

```
https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd&order=market_cap_desc&per_page=250&sparkline=true&price_change_percentage=24h
```

## Customization

### Adding More Cryptocurrencies

By default, the application fetches the top 250 cryptocurrencies. You can modify the `per_page` parameter in the API call to fetch more or fewer cryptocurrencies.

### Changing the Update Interval

The application refreshes data every 60 seconds. To change this interval, modify the second parameter of the `setInterval` call in the `useEffect` hook.
